# Text Editor

## What is a Text Editor?

Text editors are software that can be used through a web browser or downloaded onto a computer. The text editor is used to write and manage text, especially text to build websites. The text editor that comes available on my windows computer is Notepad.

## How do I Know Which One to Pick?

Text editors appear to be a personal choice; people seem to find one that suits their needs for whatever job they're trying to do. The **best** text editor is the one **you** enjoy using the most. Pragmatically speaking, choosing a text editor with a *code completion* feature will save time and accelerate completion. I don't know if I should use that in the early stages of my learning because it might create a dependency that might not always be available to me.
