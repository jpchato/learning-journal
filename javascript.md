# How to write a script for a web page?
* html, css, and javascript all work together with java being the top most layer and html being the bottom most layer.  Hence html is relatively barebones (framework)
* They work through progressive enchancement
* javascript files end with the .js file name
* objects and methods
    * document.write('Good afternoon!');
    * document = object
    * write('Good Afternoon!') = method
    * 'Good Afternoon!' = parameters
    * . = member operator
* javascript runs where it is found in the html
* Best to keep javascript code in its own file
* html script element is used in html pages to load javascript files

# Basic Javascript Instructions
* Statements
    * each line of code is a **statement**
    * curly braces indicate the start and end of a **code block**
    * javascript is case sensitive
    * statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line
* Comments
    * use comments to describe what your code does to other devs (and so you don't forget)
    * **multi-line** comments stretch over more than one line and use /**/ at start and end respectively
    * **single-line** comments are created by using // and they are usually a short description of the code
* Variables
    * **variables** are used to store data temporarily
    * Once you leave a page, variables will be lost
    * variable data can change each time a script runs
    * **calculated** and **computed** 
    * equal sign '=' means something different in javascript
    * var quantity;
    * quantity = 3;
    * var=variable keyword
    * quantity=variable name
    * 3=variable value
    * '=' = variable value
* Data Types
    *  Numeric data type
        * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc
        * negative numbers ok
    * String data type
        * consists of letters and other characters
        * 'Hi, Ivy!'
    * Boolean Data Type
        * true/false statements (yes/no; 0/1)
