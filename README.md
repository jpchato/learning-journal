## About Me
My name is Jesse Pena.  I'm was born in Los Angeles, but I've been *mostly* living in Washington since April 2013. I'm an Army Veteran, Evergreen State College Alumni, and proud fur Dad of my dog CJ and cat Cedar. I love spending time with my fianc√©e and look forward to getting married eventually.

My current hobbies are gaming, playing with my dog, and lifting weights.

This will track my learning as I work through the courses at CodeFellows.
