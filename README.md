# Learning-Journal

## About Me
My name is Jesse Pena.  I'm an Army Veteran, The Evergreen State College Alumni, and proud fur Dad of my dog CJ and cat Cedar.

My current hobbies are gaming, playing with my dog, lifting weights, and spending time with my girlfriend.

This will track my learning as I work through the courses at CodeFellows.
