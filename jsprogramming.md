# Javascript

* How JS makes web pages more interactive
    1. **Access** content
        * js can slect any element, attribute, or text from an html page
    2. **Modify** content
        * js can add to elements, attributes, and text of page (or remove)
    3. **Program** rules
        * Create a set of steps that browser will follow which allows it to modify the page
    4. **React** to events
        * Can have a script run when a specific event occurs

* Examples of what JS can do
    * slideshows, forms, relaod parts of a page, filter data

* What is a script and how do I create one?
    * A script is a series of instructions
        * Scripts are comparable to recipes, handbooks, and manuals
    * Scripts don't always use the entirety of their instructions

* Writing a script
    * Before writing a script, figure out what your goal is and how you're going to get there
    * Programs must give computers enough details to perform the tasks as if it were the first time every time
    * Start with the big picture and work backwards when designing a program
        1. Define the goal
            * Define what you want to achieve
        2. Design the script
            * Split the goal into several tasks.  (Flowchart)
        3. Code each step
            * Write your code in a programming language that the computer understands (JS)

* **Programmatic** problem solving
    * Computers follow a series of instructions, one after the other.

* Expressions
    * Expressions evaluate into a single value
    * Two types:
        1. Expressions that jugt assign a value to a variable
        2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

* Operators
    * Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
    * Multiple types:
        1. assignment operators
            * assign a value to a variable (color = pink;)
        2. Arithmetic operators
            * perform basic math
        3. string operators
            * combine two strings
            * greeting = 'hi' + 'molly';
        4. comparison operators
            * compare two values and return or true or false
        5. logical operators
            * combine expressions and return true or false

* Arithmetic operators
    * Operators available to javascript
        * addition +
        * subtraction -
        * division /
        * multiplication *
        * increment ++
        * decrement --
        * modulus %

* Order of execution
    * (pe)mdas

* String operator
    * Only one string operator +
        * used to join strings on either side of it
    * Joining together one or more strings is called a concatenation

* What is a function?
    * Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)
    * Helps organize code
    * Functions offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task
    * When you ask a function to perform its task you are **calling** the function
    * **Parameters** are pieces of information passed to a function
    * Function responses are known as **return value**
