### Growth Mindset
When growth mindset was being explored during lecture, I kept thinking about one person: **Russel Wilson**. He *embraces* challenges, *persists* through obstacles, puts in *maximum effort* on every play, he is *inspired* by others success, and he achieves excellene.  He is the first quarterback to have winning seasons for his first 8 seasons. 

Three ways to maintain a growth mindset:
1) Soldier's Creed Summary: I will never quit.
2) Be inspired by the success of others.
3) It's supposed to be difficult. If it's easy, I'm probably doing something wrong.
