# **Structuring Web Pages with HTML**
* Understand the target audience
    * age range, men or women, country, urban or rural, income, education, etc
    * individuals or companies
* Why will people visit website?
    * Understand peoples **motivations** and **goals** for visiting your website
* What are people trying to achieve?
* What information do visitors need?
    * Offer key information and some additional supporting information that might be useful
* How often will people visit the site?
    * How often people visit can determine how often it needs to get updated.  
    * For example, a news website probably gets updated every day
* Site Maps
    * Once you know what needs to go on the page, you can begin to organize it
    * Site Map= a diagram of pages that shows structure of the site
    * Card Sorting= Placing information that visitors might need to know on separate pieces of paper and organizing them into groups
* Wireframes
    * A  sketch of important information that needs to go on each page of a site
    * Shows hierarchy of info
    * Wireframes help ensure that all necessary info for a page is included
    * **DO NOT** include color scheme, font choices, backgrounds, or images for wireframe
    * Function, not form is key at this stage
*  Getting Your Message Across Using Design
    * Goal of visual design is to communicate
    * Organization of information on a webpage helps user identify what is important
    * Content
        * Webpages have lots of info to share.  Important to **prioritize** and **organize** the info
    * Prioritizing
        * Draw attention to or away from certain pieces of content by making them **distinct**
        * Designers use **visual hierarchy** to help users focus on what's important
    * Organizing
        * **Grouping** related content into **blocks** or **chunks** simplifies the page
        * Use **similar** visual style for certain types of information to help users associate that style with a certain type of content
* Visual Hierarchy
    * Use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets your key message across
    * Size
        * Larger elements grab users' attention
    * Color
        * Colors can draw attention, especially brighter colors
    * Style
        * Different style from background will draw attention
* Grouping and Similarity
    * Proximity
        * Items place close together are perceived to be related
    * Closure
        * Complicated arrangements promp readers to create real or imaginary boxes around elements
    * Continuance
        * Items placed in a line or curve are perceived to be related
    * White Space
        * Less white space between items=more related and vice versa
    * Color
        * Background colors behind items can emphasize their connection
    * Borders    
        * Boxes things together
* Designing Navigation
    * Helps people find where they want to go and helps them understand how site is organized
    * Components of good navigation:
        * Concise
            * No more than eight links
        * Clear
            * Single descriptive words for each link
        * Selective
            * Should reflect sections or content of site (no log in, legal, or search info)
        * Context
            * Let user know where they are in the website
            * Use a different color scheme or visual to indicate where nav is
        * Interactive
            * Link should be big enough to click on and visually distinct from other content on the page
        * Consistent
            * Primary navigation should remain the same
## Summary
* Understand who audience is, why they're visiting the site, what info they want, and when they are likely to return
* Site maps allow designers to plan site structure
* Wireframes organize the info that will go on each web page
* Design is communication. Visual hierarchy helps express what you are trying to say
* Color, size, and style help make information distinct
* Grouping and similarity help simplify the info being presented

# **Structure**
* HTML describes the structure of a web page
* Looking at how other sites are built
    * Right click>view source
* HTML pages are text documents
* HTML tags give information they wrap special meaning
* Tags=elements
* Tags *usually* come in pairs. Don't forget to close tags

# **HTML5 Layout**
* div is being replaced by more expressive terms such as header, page, article, paragraph, footer, etc
* List of HTML5 tags:
    * header, footer, nav, article,aside, section, hgroup, figure, figcaption, div
* HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page as opposed to div
* Older browsers do not understand HTML5. They need to be told which elements are block-level elements
* Extra JavaScript is needed for HTML5 work in IE8

# **Extra Markup**
* Several different versions of HTML have been used since the creation of the web (HTML 4, XHTML 1.0)
* To create a comment in html ...
