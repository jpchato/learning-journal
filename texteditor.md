# Text Editors

## What is a Text Editor?

Text editors are software that can be used through a web browser or downloaded onto a computer. The text editor is used to write and manage text, especially text to build websites. The text editor that comes available on my windows computer is Notepad. Notepad does not have many features available, which is likely why we have been informed that we will be using VS text editing software throughout most of our time at codefellows.

## How do I Know Which One to Pick?

Text editors appear to be a personal choice; people seem to find one that suits their needs for whatever job they're trying to do. The **best** text editor is the one **you** enjoy using the most. Pragmatically speaking, choosing a text editor with a *code completion* feature will save time and accelerate completion. I don't know if I should use that in the early stages of my learning because it might create a dependency that might not always be available to me.

## Decisions, Decisions, Decisions

There are many different text editors to choose from.  In a way, we're lucky that we don't have to decide which one to use for our work. However, here are some different text editors available:

* Notepad++
* Text Wrangler
* BB Edit
* Visual Studio Code
* Atom
* Brackets
* Sublime Text

# Extremely Important Note
* Save your files with the **appropriate extension** at the **end of the file name** (.html, .css, .md)

# Terminals
The terminal (aka the command prompt) is a way to communicate with the system via text. On my computer I can pull it via the search bar by typing in command prompt into the search bar at the lower half of my screen. 

There are various shortcuts in the command prompt.  For instance, you can use the up and down arrows to look through your history if you want to return to a previous prompt.
