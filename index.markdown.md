# Markdown
Markdown is a shortcut to HTML tools.  Markdown does not provide as much control as HTML, but it *seems* to be sufficient.  There are tools to:

1) **bold**
2) *italicize*
3) make lists

It also allows you to make words
# From this big
###### To this small

## Anticipating Use
I anticipate using markdown as I continue to learn and develop my skills here at CodeFellows.
